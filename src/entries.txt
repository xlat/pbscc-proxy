the line with one symbol "\f" (asci=12) is a separator between entries

1 Name
2 Kind (file,dir) //the last item for not owner dirs except when it's scheduled for something
3 Revision (usualy setup for owner dirs)
4 Url (usually valid only for owner)
5 Repository (usually valid only for owner)
6 Schedule (delete,add,replace)
7 Text Timestamp (File Timestamp ?)
8 Checksum (32 bytes of 0-9 and a-f characters) ex:e71c273fbb7f2b04b6e39459a0299c24
9 Last Commit Timestamp (2005-11-15T14:16:31.653187Z)
10 Last Commit Revision (usually valid for files)
11 Last Commit Author
